<h2>2 Peter 1:1–11</h2>

<p>The <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108077" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">believers</span> that <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108572" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Peter</span> wrote to had received the message of the <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108043" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">good news</span>.</p><p>They had been rescued from evil in the <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108215" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">world</span>. <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108199" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">God</span> had given them everything they needed to follow <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108219" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Jesus’</span> example.</p><p>They could live a godly and <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108361" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">holy</span> life like Jesus did. They needed to keep learning and growing in the <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108232" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">faith</span>.</p><p>Peter made it clear that this required effort and hard <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108208" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">work</span>. He listed seven ways believers should keep growing. This list is like <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108102" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Paul’s</span> list of the <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108154" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">fruit of the Holy Spirit</span> in Galatians 5:22–23.</p><p>As believers know Jesus more and more, they become more and more like him. This is how they share in God’s nature. Growing in the faith allows believers to be useful as Jesus’ kingdom spreads on earth. Jesus’ kingdom is the <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108561" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">kingdom of God</span>.</p></div>

<h2>2 Peter 1:12–21</h2>

<p>Peter believed that he would die soon. It was important for him to remind the believers of the truth about Jesus. He explained two ways that he and other <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108053" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">apostles</span> knew the truth.</p><p>First, they had been with Jesus while he lived and served on earth. Peter, <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108119" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">James</span> and <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108542" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">John</span> had seen Jesus’ <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108348" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">glory</span> in a way that others hadn’t. They saw it with their own eyes when they were on the mountain with Jesus (Matthew 17:1–8).</p><p>Second, the apostles understood that there were many <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108400" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">prophecies about Jesus</span> in the <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108192" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Old Testament</span>. The <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108416" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">prophets</span> hadn’t made up the words. They had spoken the words that the <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108388" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Holy Spirit</span> gave them. These <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108399" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">prophecies</span> were fulfilled in Jesus’ life.</p><p>One of these was spoken by <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108398" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Balaam</span>. Balaam talked about a star coming from the <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108220" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">family line</span> of <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108268" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Jacob</span> (Numbers 24:17).</p><p>Peter called Jesus the Morning Star. This was a way to talk about how Jesus brings God’s <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108546" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">light</span> into the world. Peter said that the world will be a <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108039" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">dark</span> place until <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108065" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Jesus’ return</span>.</p></div>
<div style='direction: ltr;'>
<h2>2 Peter 2:1–9</h2>

<p>Peter warned the believers not to trust teachers who taught things that weren’t true. False teachers didn’t want what was good for the believers. They wanted to take advantage of Jesus’ followers.</p><p>Peter made it clear that God would stop them and bring <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108233" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">judgement</span> against them. He used three examples from the Old Testament. These examples showed that God knows how to judge and punish <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108218" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">evil spiritual beings</span>.</p><p>The same is true for <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108525" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">ungodly people</span>. The examples also showed that God knows how to protect godly people.</p></div>
<div style='direction: ltr;'>
<h2>2 Peter 2:10–22</h2>

<p>In chapter 1, Peter talked about certain believers. They had forgotten that their past sins (<span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108195" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">sin</span>) had been washed away.</p><p>Washing away sins is a way to talk about being <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108281" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">forgiven</span>. Here Peter talked more about these believers. They followed sinful desires on purpose.</p><p>The main thing about these believers was that they hated to be under authority. They didn’t want to humbly serve Jesus as their Master. They sought freedom to do whatever they wanted.</p><p>Peter made it clear that this wasn’t real freedom. It only made these believers <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108258" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">slaves</span> to the evil desires that controlled them. They served sin as their master instead of serving Jesus. Peter wrote clearly about God’s judgement against these people.</p></div>
<div style='direction: ltr;'>
<h2>2 Peter 3:1–10</h2>

<p>Jesus had promised to return to earth. For many years after Jesus’ <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108568" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">resurrection</span>, believers expected that he would return very soon.</p><p>Then some believers began to doubt that he would come back. Some people made fun of believers for thinking that Jesus would return. Peter explained that God isn’t slow to act or unable to keep his promises. Instead, he is patient. <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108229" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">God chooses</span> to wait. He wants people to <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108346" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">repent</span> and to turn away from their sins. He is giving everyone the opportunity to turn back to him.</p><p>Peter described <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108055" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">judgement day</span> coming like a thief. Jesus had also talked about it like that in Luke 12:39. Peter described God’s <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108233" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">judgement</span> like fire that destroys the <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108201" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">heavens</span> and the earth.</p><p>He was talking about the kind of fire that melts gold and makes it pure. The book of <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108578" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Malachi</span> also talks about this kind of fire (Malachi 3:1–3). The fire would burn away everything in the heavens and the earth that opposed God.</p></div>
<div style='direction: ltr;'>
<h2>2 Peter 3:11–18</h2>

<p>Peter told the believers how they were to live while they waited for Jesus to return. They were to live holy lives. This included being at <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108211" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">peace</span> with God.</p><p>It included staying away from false teachers. Instead they must hold on to true teaching like Peter and Paul taught. Peter’s teachings agreed with Paul’s teachings.</p><p><span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108044" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Holy living</span> included knowing Jesus the <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108329" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Lord</span> and <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108319" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Saviour</span> more and more. Then believers would feel God’s <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108235" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">grace</span> more deeply every day.</p><p>The believers were to do all these things as they looked forward to Jesus’ return. Jesus isn’t coming to destroy the world. He is going to judge it and make it pure. That is why Peter spoke about a new heaven and a new earth. He was talking about the <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108543" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">new creation</span>. Believers must wait with hope and patience for God to keep this promise.</p></div>
