<h2>Zechariah 1:1–8:23</h2>

<p><span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108199" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">God</span> gave some messages to <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108511" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Zechariah</span> by speaking to him. He gave Zechariah other messages through <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108296" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">visions</span>. Zechariah shared these messages while the people of <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108291" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Judah</span> were rebuilding the <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108417" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">temple</span>. The story about this is recorded in Ezra chapters 5 and 6.</p><p>The messages had two main points. The first main point was about the <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108328" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Mount Sinai covenant</span>. The people of Zechariah’s time needed to be faithful to the <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108237" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">covenant</span>. Their people from long ago hadn’t done this. They hadn’t <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108332" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">worshipped only God</span>. They hadn’t treated others the way God taught them to in the <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108335" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Law of Moses</span>. They hadn’t listened to the <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108416" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">prophets</span> who warned them to stop doing evil deeds. They hadn’t turned away from their <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108195" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">sin</span> and <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108346" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">repented</span>.</p><p>That is why God brought <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108233" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">judgement</span> against the <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108479" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">northern kingdom</span> and the <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108480" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">southern kingdom</span>. The <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108493" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Assyrian</span> government had taken control of the northern kingdom of <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108280" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Israel</span>. The <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108498" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Babylonian</span> government had taken control of the southern kingdom of Judah. The temple had been destroyed. Many of <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108199" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">God’s people</span> had been forced to leave their land. They had been scattered among other nations and lived in <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108495" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">exile</span>.</p><p>Many of God’s people understood that God’s judgement against them was right and fair. The people had shown how sad they were about God’s judgement. They showed it by mourning and going without food at certain times. Zechariah explained the way that God wanted them to show their sadness. It wasn’t by <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108456" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">fasting</span>. It was by treating people with justice. This was like the message about fasting recorded in Isaiah chapter 58. God had explained how to treat people with justice in the Law of Moses. After the exile God’s people were still required to follow those laws.</p></div>

<h2>Zechariah 9:1–14:21</h2>

<p>These chapters include <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108534" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">messages of judgement</span> and messages of hope. In many ways they are like messages recorded in other books of prophecy.</p><p>The judgement was against the nations that were around the land of Judah. God promised to destroy the nations that attacked his people. This included the nations that treated the family line of <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108268" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Jacob</span> badly. It also included all people groups that were proud and that didn’t respect God. God promised to destroy them on the <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108571" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">day of the Lord</span>. This was described using <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108541" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">apocalyptic writing</span>.</p><p>The judgement was also against many of the leaders of God’s people. These leaders didn’t follow God’s example for <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108209" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">rulers</span>. God compared them to a foolish <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108278" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">shepherd</span>. God’s judgement against them would be terrible.</p><p>The messages of hope were about the time when God will rule completely as King. Some people will be left alive after the time of judgement. They are the ones who recognise that God is the only true God. They will worship only God and obey him. This includes people from Jacob’s family line. It also includes people from all nations. They will all be considered God’s people. God will be the shepherd who takes care of his people. God will stop all wars and there will be <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108211" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">peace</span> everywhere on earth.</p><p>Water that gives life will flow from Jerusalem. This was also called the water of life or <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108559" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">living water</span>. <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108555" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Ezekiel</span> also talked about water flowing out from Jerusalem (Ezekiel 47:1–12). The city of Jerusalem in these messages was like the <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108549" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">new Jerusalem</span> described in Revelation chapter 21.</p><p>Many years later these messages of hope helped Jesus’ followers. The messages helped them understand Jesus’ life and work. New Testament writers understood many of these messages as <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108400" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">prophecies about Jesus</span>. This was the case for the king riding on a donkey. It was the case for the faithful shepherd that God’s people killed. It was the case for the one they pierced and mourned over. It was the case for the fountain that washed away their sins.</p></div>
