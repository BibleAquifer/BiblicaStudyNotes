<h2>Titus 1:1–9</h2>

<p>When <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108102" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Paul</span> greeted <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108152" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Titus</span>, Paul called him his true son in the <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108232" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">faith</span>.</p><p>The hope and faith that they shared joined them together like family members in <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108045" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">God’s family</span>.</p><p>As an <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108053" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">apostle</span>, Paul worked to teach people the truth about who <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108219" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Jesus</span> is.</p><p>Understanding this truth and believing it changes the way people live. Because of it they follow Jesus’ example for living. Paul called this godly living or <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108044" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">holy living</span>.</p><p>The truth about Jesus fills people with the hope of living for ever with <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108098" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Christ</span>.</p><p>Titus worked together with Paul to help people <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108255" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">believe in</span> Jesus.</p><p>To do this on <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108163" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Crete</span>, he needed to appoint faithful leaders in the <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108096" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">churches</span>.</p><p>Many things are required of people who serve as <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108118" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">church elders</span> or leaders.</p><p>Paul listed ten things that they must do and five things that they mustn’t do. This is like the list Paul wrote about church leaders in 1 Timothy 3:1–16.</p><p>Above all, church leaders must be firmly committed to the truth about Jesus Christ.</p></div>

<h2>Titus 1:10–16</h2>

<p>Some <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108077" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">believers</span> in Crete who were <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108503" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Jewish</span> claimed to know <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108199" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">God</span> but didn’t obey him. They taught things that went against the truth about Jesus. They did this to take advantage of people and take their money.</p><p>Paul called these people the <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108257" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">circumcision</span> group. They taught that Jesus didn’t save <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108547" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Gentiles</span> unless they followed <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108070" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Jewish laws</span>. The laws this group cared about most were the ones that separated Jews from Gentiles. They were about males being circumcised and about things that were considered <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108364" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">pure</span> or <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108363" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">clean</span>.</p><p>Their understanding of what was right and wrong was based on the teachings of other people. It wasn’t based on what Jesus taught. Their teachings caused problems for the community of believers and had to be stopped. Jesus taught that nothing people did to their bodies could make them clean or pure (Mark 7:1–23). Paul reminded Titus that Jesus’ followers are already pure and accepted by God.</p></div>

<h2>Titus 2:1–15</h2>

<p>Paul showed how each one of <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108302" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">God’s people</span> had important <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108208" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">work</span> to do.</p><p>They were to treat one another in ways that taught unbelievers about God. These ways were very different from what was common in Crete. In Crete it was common to tell lies, be lazy and eat too much (Titus 1:12).</p><p>God’s <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108235" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">grace</span> taught believers in Crete to say no to <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108195" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">sin</span>. It taught them how to live in godly and <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108361" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">holy</span> ways.</p><p>Believers were to obey <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108098" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Christ</span> in their homes, in their work and in all their relationships. All members of each family should control themselves and treat one another with respect and love. They must be honest, kind and worthy of trust.</p><p>They must do this as they wait in hope for <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108065" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Jesus’ return</span>. Titus was to teach, correct and encourage the believers about all these things.</p></div>
<div style='direction: ltr;'>
<h2>Titus 3:1–15</h2>

<p>Paul talked about being ready and committed to doing good. God doesn’t save people because they do <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108060" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">good works</span>. He saves them because he freely gives his kindness, love and <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108342" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">mercy</span>.</p><p>As people receive God’s kindness, they change. They stop being full of hate and evil. They start being gentle and treating others with kindness and love like God does. This happens when God <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108281" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">forgives</span> their sins and the <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108388" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Holy Spirit</span> gives them new life.</p><p>Some believers in Crete didn’t want to do good to others. They preferred to fight and argue about things that didn’t matter. They wanted to divide the believers into groups instead of living together in <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108211" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">peace</span>. Paul warned Titus to stay away from people like that.</p><p>One way Titus was to do good was to help believers who were travelling. Paul wanted Titus to make sure that they had what they needed for their trip. This would be an example to the churches in Crete. The believers were to provide for people when they had needs. That way they would be showing God’s kindness and love to everyone.</p></div>
