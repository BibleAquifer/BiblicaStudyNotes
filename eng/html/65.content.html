<h2>Jude 1:1–4</h2>

<p><span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108168" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Jude</span> could have described himself as the brother of <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108219" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Jesus</span> and of <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108119" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">James</span>. Instead he said that he was the servant of Jesus the <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108329" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Lord</span> and King. This showed that Jude was humble.</p><p>Jude told the <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108077" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">believers</span> that they were chosen, loved and safe. This would encourage them as they dealt with a danger that the <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108096" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">church</span> faced. The danger was that <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108525" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">ungodly people</span> were teaching things that weren’t true. They encouraged believers to stop being faithful to the <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108043" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">good news</span>.</p><p>So Jude wrote to encourage the believers to stand up for the <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108232" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">faith</span>. This means to struggle to hold on to what is true about <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108199" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">God</span>. It means to work hard to stay faithful to the way God wants people to live. This struggle happens inside of people as they grow in believing and following Jesus. It happens in their relationships with others as they refuse to believe people who teach lies.</p><p>One lie that people in Jude’s time taught was about God’s <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108235" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">grace</span>. They taught that God’s grace gave them permission to do whatever they wanted. They used this as permission to commit sexual <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108195" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">sins</span>. This lie led them to say no to obeying Jesus <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108098" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Christ</span> as <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108527" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Messiah</span> and King.</p><p><span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108572" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Peter</span> had also written about people who hated to be under Jesus’ authority (2 Peter 2:10).</p></div>

<h2>Jude 1:5–16</h2>

<p>Ungodly people and <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108218" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">evil spiritual beings</span> had caused problems for <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108302" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">God’s people</span> before.</p><p>Jude gave many examples of this from <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108280" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Israel’s</span> past. These stories are found in the <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108192" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Old Testament</span> and in other <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108503" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Jewish</span> writings.</p><p>Some of the examples showed God’s <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108233" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">judgement</span> against those who opposed him. These examples included Israelites, <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108313" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">angels</span> and the people of <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108249" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Sodom and Gomorrah</span>.</p><p>Other examples showed what the ungodly people in the church were like. They didn’t accept authority like the angel <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108565" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Michael</span> did. Jude compared them to <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108222" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Cain</span>, <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108398" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Balaam</span> and <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108393" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Korah</span>.</p><p>He also compared them to things in nature. This showed that they weren’t doing what they were meant to do. The last example was about how they didn’t pay attention to warnings. Jude mentioned a <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108399" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">prophecy</span> from the <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108169" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Book of Enoch</span> about God judging ungodly people. But the ungodly people in Jude’s time didn’t listen to the warnings. They continued to follow their evil desires.</p></div>

<h2>Jude 1:17–25</h2>

<p>Jude didn’t want his dear friends to be like the ungodly people in the church. Those people wanted to separate the believers into groups.</p><p>Staying together depended on remaining in God’s love together. This was like Jesus’ teaching in John 15:9–10 about remaining in his love. The believers were to grow strong together in their faith. They were to trust the <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108388" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Holy Spirit</span> to guide them and help them. They were to <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108227" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">pray</span> together.</p><p>As they waited for Jesus’ <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108342" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">mercy</span>, they were to show mercy to one another. How to do this depended on what each person needed.</p><p>Jude ended his letter by praising God. As the believers struggled for the faith they could trust in the true God. God is able to protect his people from the power of sin. God is their <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108319" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Saviour</span> and will bring them into his <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108348" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">glory</span> in <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108201" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">heaven</span>.</p><p>Jude was talking about the <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108561" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">kingdom of God</span>. This brings joy to God and to believers. The <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108146" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Lord Jesus Christ</span> will be praised for ever.</p></div>
