<h2>Amos 1:1–2:16</h2>

<p><span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108562" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Amos</span> spoke <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108534" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">messages of judgement</span> about the nations around the <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108479" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">northern kingdom</span>.</p><p>The messages were recorded as <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108204" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">poems</span>. They were about the <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108434" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Arameans</span> of <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108540" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Damascus</span>, the <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108267" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Philistines</span> and the people of <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108475" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Tyre</span>.</p><p>They were about the <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108411" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Edomites</span>, <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108412" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Ammonites</span>, <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108397" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Moabites</span> and the people of the <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108480" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">southern kingdom</span>.</p><p>The lands of these people groups were located in a circle. The northern kingdom was in the centre of this circle.</p><p>Amos then talked about <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108199" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">God</span> bringing <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108233" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">judgement</span> against the northern kingdom as well.</p></div>

<h2>Amos 3:1–6:14</h2>

<p>The people and leaders of the northern kingdom treated people badly. This was the main <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108195" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">sin</span> that Amos talked about. Treating people badly was very common while King Jeroboam the second ruled the northern kingdom.</p><p>This <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108330" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">king</span> ruled many years after the first King <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108476" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Jeroboam</span> ruled. In Amos’ time, Jeroboam’s army had won many victories over the nations around them. The northern kingdom had grown large and many people had become wealthy. They had also become full of pride. They treated people badly in many ways.</p><p>They stopped <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108416" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">prophets</span> from sharing God’s messages. They stopped <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108384" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Nazirites</span> from keeping their promises to God. Men committed sexual sins with and against girls. The people and leaders stole things. They stored up more and more things for themselves. They did this even though some people didn’t have enough.</p><p>Those who were rich took advantage of <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108418" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">needy people</span>. They charged unfair prices that poor people couldn’t pay. Then they made poor people <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108258" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">slaves</span> when they couldn’t pay their debts. Those who were rich didn’t allow poor people their rights in court. They cared about being rich and comfortable. They didn’t care about justice or doing good to others.</p><p>This showed that they weren’t worshipping and obeying God with all their <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108419" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">heart</span>. They pretended to worship God. They offered some of the <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108256" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">sacrifices</span> and offerings talked about in the <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108335" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Law of Moses</span>. They celebrated some of the <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108372" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">feasts</span> described in the <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108328" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Mount Sinai covenant</span>. But they didn’t follow God’s rules about how to treat others.</p><p>The main law about that was recorded in Leviticus 19:18. It said that <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108302" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">God’s people</span> were to love their <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108370" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">neighbours</span> as they loved themselves. And the people and leaders of the northern kingdom didn’t <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108332" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">worship only God</span>. They worshipped statues of <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108341" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">metal calves</span> on <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108285" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">altars</span> in the city of <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108272" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Bethel</span>. The people and leaders also worshipped <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108401" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Baal</span> in a temple in <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108489" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Samaria</span>.</p><p>God had allowed some of the <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108380" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">covenant curses</span> to come to the northern kingdom. He did this to warn them to turn away from their sins. God wanted his people to treat others fairly and to do what is right. But the people refused to <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108346" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">repent</span> and turn back to God. This made God very angry. Amos described <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108500" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">God’s anger</span> like the loud roar of a lion.</p></div>

<h2>Amos 7:1–9:15</h2>

<p>God gave Amos four <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108296" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">visions</span> about bringing judgement against <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108268" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Jacob</span>’s people.</p><p>After the first two visions, Amos <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108227" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">prayed</span> and asked God to <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108281" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">forgive</span> his people. God had <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108342" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">mercy</span> and pity and decided not to destroy them.</p><p>But that didn’t happen after the third and fourth visions. After those visions God said that he would no longer spare his people. This meant that God would stop the northern kingdom’s evil deeds. He would stop them by bringing judgement against his people. The places where they worshipped <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108284" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">false gods</span> would be destroyed. The king and his family would be killed. The people would be forced to leave their land and to live in <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108495" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">exile</span>. This was the worst of the covenant curses.</p><p>Amos kept announcing this message even when a <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108333" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">priest</span> in Bethel tried to stop him. Amos had said that this judgement would come on the <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108571" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">day of the Lord</span>. Amos used <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108541" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">apocalyptic writing</span> to describe that time of judgement.</p><p>For the northern kingdom, the day of the <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108226" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Lord</span> came in 722 <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108494" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">BC</span>. Amos’ <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108399" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">prophecies</span> came true when <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108493" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Assyria</span> took control of the northern kingdom.</p><p>Amos offered one message of hope. God promised that he wouldn’t destroy all the people of the northern kingdom. He promised to set up <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108449" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">David</span>’s fallen shelter. This was a way of talking about God’s <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108466" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">covenant with David</span>. It meant that someone from David’s <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108220" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">family line</span> would once again rule as king. People from Edom and all nations would be part of God’s people. God’s people would enjoy the <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108379" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">covenant blessings</span>.</p><p><span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108503" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Jews</span> came to understand this message of hope as a prophecy about the <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108527" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">messiah</span>. <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108528" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">New Testament</span> writers came to understand that <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108219" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Jesus</span> is the Messiah.</p></div>
