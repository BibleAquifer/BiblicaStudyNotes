<h2>Colossians 1:1–14</h2>

<p><span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108159" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Epaphras</span> had shared the <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108043" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">good news</span> about <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108219" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Jesus</span> with people in <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108160" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Colossae</span>.</p><p>Then he travelled to see <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108102" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Paul</span> and told him about the Colossian <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108077" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">believers</span>.</p><p>The Colossians had a strong <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108232" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">faith</span> in Jesus and a deep love for one another. This was based on the hope of what <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108199" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">God’s people</span> will receive from him in the future.</p><p>Paul called faith, hope and love the fruit of the good news. When the truth about Jesus is preached, it changes those who accept it. People start thinking, speaking and acting in ways that please <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108199" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">God</span>. That is what Paul meant when he spoke about fruit.</p><p>Paul’s <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108227" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">prayer</span> for the Colossian believers was that they would keep bearing fruit. This included being patient and giving thanks to God. It included having <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108325" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">wisdom</span> and understanding and knowing God. These things prepared them to live for ever with Jesus in the <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108561" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">kingdom of God</span>.</p></div>
<div style='direction: ltr;'>
<h2>Colossians 1:15–23</h2>

<p>Paul described exactly who Jesus is and what he has done. Jesus is God and shows people what God is like. <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108098" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Christ</span> is the starting point of everything that exist. He gives everything meaning. Even <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108423" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">spiritual beings</span> were created by him.</p><p>Paul described Jesus as the head of the body. He was talking about the <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108143" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">body of Christ</span> and the <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108096" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">church</span>. This means that Jesus is the church’s leader and believers must follow his example.</p><p>In the future believers will rise from the dead like Jesus did. That is the <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108568" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">resurrection</span>. They will have life that can’t be destroyed. Christ’s death brings God and his <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108197" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">creation</span> back together again in <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108211" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">peace</span>.</p><p>When Jesus gave up his life on the <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108530" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">cross</span>, he stopped the power of <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108195" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">sin</span>. Those who trust in Christ are free from the blame and guilt of sin. Paul encouraged the Colossians to keep growing strong in the hope that the good news brings.</p></div>

<h2>Colossians 1:24–2:5</h2>

<p>When he was on earth, Jesus <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108256" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">sacrificed</span> himself for others because he loved them. This brought him terrible suffering. But his suffering led to <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108348" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">glory</span> when God raised him from the dead.</p><p>Paul followed Jesus’ example of serving others out of love. He served them by sharing the truth about Jesus. Paul shared all of <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108200" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">God’s word</span>. Paul preached to <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108503" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Jews</span> and <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108547" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Gentiles</span> that Jesus is <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108329" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Lord</span> of everything.</p><p>He was put in prison for preaching this. He was suffering because he had followed Jesus’ example faithfully. In this way, his suffering was part of Jesus’ suffering. Suffering didn’t stop Paul from working hard as an <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108053" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">apostle</span>. Jesus gave him strength to keep working.</p><p>Even from prison he worked hard to help believers grow strong in the faith. He didn’t want them to be fooled by teachings that sounded good but weren’t true. He wanted believers to fully understand that Jesus Christ lives inside of them. This truth is what Paul called the <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108145" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">mystery of Christ</span>.</p></div>
<div style='direction: ltr;'>
<h2>Colossians 2:6–23</h2>

<p>The Colossians <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108255" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">believed in</span> the <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108146" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Lord Jesus Christ</span>. Yet many of them had also started to believe teachings that weren’t true.</p><p>They were being taught that they needed to follow <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108070" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Jewish laws</span>. As a result they thought they should be <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108257" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">circumcised</span> and obey laws about Jewish <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108372" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">feasts</span>.</p><p>They believed that they should have <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108296" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">visions</span> and worship <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108313" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">angels</span>. They also believed that they should be strict about what they could eat and touch.</p><p>Paul made it very clear that the people teaching these things were pretenders. They wanted to control the Colossians. Paul also made it clear that the Colossians didn’t need to do those things. They already had everything they needed and were complete. This was because they belonged to Jesus.</p><p>Jesus’ followers are joined closely to him through <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108037" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">baptism</span>. Baptism is a picture of being buried with Jesus and raised to life with him. Going down into the water during baptism is a way to act out dying. Then believers come up out of the water. This is a way to act out being raised from the dead. Believers have new life with Christ. So they mustn’t be controlled by anyone or anything else. They must say no to anything that teaches that Jesus isn’t Lord.</p></div>
<div style='direction: ltr;'>
<h2>Colossians 3:1–17</h2>

<p>The old ways that the Colossian believers used to live had to stop. Their old ways of thinking, speaking and acting were sinful. These ways caused harm to them and their communities.</p><p>The Colossians had to stop obeying their sinful desires because they now had new life. Jesus is the centre of the new life of all believers. Paul said that Jesus is everything and is in everything. He meant that Jesus is the most important one who exists. Nothing is beyond Christ’s rule.</p><p>Because of this, the ways that <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108202" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">human beings</span> divide into different groups no longer matter. God’s people are to live together as one body. This is possible because the peace of Jesus rules in their <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108419" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">hearts</span>. When they understand how dearly God loves them, they can love one another.</p></div>
<div style='direction: ltr;'>
<h2>Colossians 3:18–4:1</h2>

<p>Earlier Paul gave instructions about how believers were to live together in <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108045" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">God’s family</span>. They were to put on tender <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108342" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">mercy</span> and kindness as if they were clothes.</p><p>Paul showed how they were to do this within their human families as well. His instructions were different from what was common in <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108047" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Roman</span> lands in his time. It was common for women, children and <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108258" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">slaves</span> to be taught to obey. Yet Paul taught believers to base their relationships on serving Jesus.</p><p>Everyone was to follow Jesus’ example of being a <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108059" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">leader who serves</span>. Paul taught husbands to show love. He taught fathers to show kindness. He taught masters to be humble and fair. And he reminded all believers that they are slaves of the Lord Jesus. Jesus is the Master they must all obey.</p></div>
<div style='direction: ltr;'>
<h2>Colossians 4:2–6</h2>

<p>In chapter 1 Paul had told the Colossian believers about his prayers for them. Here he asked them to pray for him and those who worked with him. This showed what a humble leader Paul was. He wanted the Colossians to be partners with him in his work.</p><p>Even though they had never met one another, they could be joined together through prayer. Paul encouraged the Colossians to be wise in how they spoke and acted. Their words were to be full of <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108235" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">grace</span> as they answered questions about Jesus.</p></div>
<div style='direction: ltr;'>
<h2>Colossians 4:7–18</h2>

<p>Paul mentioned several of the people who worked together with him. Most of them were Gentiles like <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108161" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Onesimus</span>.</p><p>Many Jewish believers opposed Paul for preaching that Jesus welcomed Gentiles into God’s family. That was why he was in prison at that time. So it was comforting to Paul to have Jews like John <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108069" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Mark</span> and Justus work with him.</p><p>Paul also mentioned several people in churches near Colossae. All these men and women respected and cared deeply for one another. Paul was giving an example of God’s people living in peace as one body.</p><p><span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108120" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Paul’s letter</span> ended with instructions to the churches in Colossae and <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108162" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Laodicea</span>. It was common practice for the churches to share his letters. This was another way Paul encouraged believers to be bound together in love.</p></div>
