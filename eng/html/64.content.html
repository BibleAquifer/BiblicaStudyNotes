<h2>3 John 1:1–15</h2>

<p><span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108542" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">John</span> called himself the elder. He may have been talking about his age or about being a <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108096" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">church elder</span>.</p><p>He was full of joy because his friend Gaius’ <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108462" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">spiritual</span> life was going well. This meant that Gaius was following <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108219" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Jesus</span> faithfully.</p><p>In 1 John 3:18 John wrote about <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108077" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">believers</span> putting their <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108232" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">faith</span> and love into action. Gaius did that by welcoming and helping believers who were traveling. In this way he supported people who spread the <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108043" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">good news</span> about Jesus.</p><p>This was very different from what a man named Diotrephes did. Diotrephes ruled over others in the <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108096" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">church</span>. This went against <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108572" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Peter’s</span> instructions for church leaders (1 Peter 5:3).</p><p>Diotrephes told lies about John. John planned to speak to Diotrephes about what he was doing wrong. His plan agreed with what <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108102" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Paul</span> taught about correcting <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108118" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">church elders</span> in 1 Timothy 5:20.</p><p>John wanted Gaius to avoid doing evil and instead to do good. Demetrius was an example of a believer who did good. He was faithful to the truth about Jesus.</p></div>
