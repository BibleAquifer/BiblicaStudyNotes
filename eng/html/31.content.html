<h2>Obadiah 1:1–21</h2>

<p>The <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108416" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">prophet</span> Obadiah announced <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108534" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">messages of judgement</span> against <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108411" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Edom</span>. These were like the <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108534" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">messages of judgement</span> against Edom recorded in Jeremiah 49. Obadiah explained why <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108199" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">God</span> would bring judgement against Edom. The Edomites were proud. They believed that their strength and <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108325" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">wisdom</span> kept them safe. This showed that they didn’t respect God’s authority as the <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108226" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Lord</span> and King. Their pride also showed that they didn’t respect God’s authority over the people of <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108291" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Judah</span>.</p><p><span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108199" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">God chose</span> to make a <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108237" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">covenant</span> with the people from the <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108220" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">family line</span> of <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108268" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Jacob</span>. The Edomites were their relatives. Yet people from <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108269" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Esau</span>’s and Jacob’s family lines didn’t live in <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108211" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">peace</span> with one another. That had been the case for hundreds of years. The Edomites made it clear that they didn’t respect God or his choices. They made this clear when <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108464" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Jerusalem</span> was attacked.</p><p>God allowed Jerusalem to be destroyed by <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108498" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Babylonian</span> armies in 586 <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108494" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">BC</span>. That was how God brought judgement against the <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108480" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">southern kingdom</span>. The Edomites didn’t respect that God was taking action against his people (<span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108199" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">God’s people</span>). Instead they took action and made the suffering of the southern kingdom worse. Obadiah explained many evil things that the Edomites did to the people of the southern kingdom. Other parts of the <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108193" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Bible</span> show how the people of Jerusalem felt about that. Psalm 137 and Lamentations chapters 2 and 4 are examples.</p><p>Obadiah announced that God would destroy the Edomites because of their pride and evil deeds. Obadiah described that time of judgement as the <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108571" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">day of the Lord</span>. It was a time when God would judge not only Edom but also all nations. Obadiah described <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108199" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">God’s anger</span> like a cup that the nations would drink from. The result of the judgement against the nations would be blessing for God’s people. They would enjoy the <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108379" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">covenant blessings</span>. This included living safely in the land God had promised to <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108243" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Abraham</span>’s family line. It included the blessing of God’s presence. That is what was meant by Zion being the holy mountain once again. God described this time of blessing as a kingdom that belonged to him.</p><p><span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108503" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Jews</span> came to understand this message of hope as a <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108399" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">prophecy</span> for the future. It would be fulfilled when God sent the <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108527" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">messiah</span>. <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108528" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">New Testament</span> writers came to understand that <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108219" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Jesus</span> is the Messiah. Jesus announced that he brought the <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108561" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">kingdom of God</span> to earth.</p></div>
