<h2>2 John 1:1–13</h2>

<p><span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108542" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">John</span> called himself the elder. He may have been talking about his age or about being a <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108118" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">church elder</span>. He said he was writing to a lady and her children whom <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108229" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">God chose</span>. This was a way to talk about the <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108096" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">church</span>.</p><p>It was common for churches to meet in someone’s home. It was also common for <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108077" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">believers</span> in <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108047" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Roman</span> lands to be <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108054" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">treated badly</span> for following <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108219" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Jesus</span>. John may have avoided using any names to protect the believers.</p><p>John wrote that the truth is that Jesus <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108098" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Christ</span> is the <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108526" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Son of God</span>. He lived on earth as a <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108202" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">human being</span> with a human body. While Jesus was on earth he taught people how to live. People who follow Jesus’ teachings belong to <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108199" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">God</span>. They are part of <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108045" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">God’s family</span> together with everyone else who follows Jesus. That is why God’s children call one another brother and sister. They obey God’s commands. They lead a life of love like Jesus did.</p><p>John also wrote about the danger of lies and false teachings about Jesus. In John’s time, some people taught that Jesus didn’t ever have a human body. This teaching was based on a way of thinking called <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108167" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Docetism</span>. These people thought that they knew many things and were proud of what they knew. John made it clear that people teaching these things didn’t follow Jesus’ teachings. They made themselves enemies of Christ. They didn’t lead a life of love. Instead, they did evil <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108208" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">work</span>. John warned the believers not to welcome such people. He meant that they weren&apos;t to be allowed to teach. John looked forward to visiting the believers and sharing his love and joy with them.</p></div>
