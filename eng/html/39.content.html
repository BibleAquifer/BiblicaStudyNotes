<h2>Malachi 1:1–5</h2>

<p><span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108578" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Malachi</span> shared most of his messages through questions and answers. <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108199" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">God</span> spoke and asked questions of his people (<span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108199" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">God’s people</span>) living in the land of <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108291" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Judah</span>. The people replied to God’s questions. They also asked him questions.</p><p>These were the people who had been left alive after God brought <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108233" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">judgement</span>. The judgement was when the <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108498" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Babylonian</span> government took control of the <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108480" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">southern kingdom</span>. This group of people included those whose families hadn’t been forced to leave the southern kingdom. The group also included <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108503" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Jews</span> who had returned to Judah from Babylon.</p><p>The <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108509" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Persian</span> government had allowed them to return and to rebuild the <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108417" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">temple</span>. The first set of questions and replies was about God’s love. <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108199" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">God chose</span> to show his love for <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108243" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Abraham</span>. He showed it by making a <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108253" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">covenant with Abraham</span> and his <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108220" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">family line</span>. God chose to continue his <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108237" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">covenant</span> with Abraham through <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108268" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Jacob</span>’s family line. That is one way he showed his love to the people of <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108280" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Israel</span>.</p><p>The people’s question about God’s love showed something. It showed what they felt about God’s choice and his covenants. They didn’t feel that these things mattered. They didn’t feel that these things helped their lives. Questions they asked later in Malachi’s messages showed this as well.</p></div>

<h2>Malachi 1:6–3:15</h2>

<p>God accused his people of many things in his questions and replies. He accused them of not honouring him or respecting him. They showed this by not living according to the ways God had taught them. God had explained his ways for living in the <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108335" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Law of Moses</span>. The people had promised to follow God’s ways. They made this promise in the <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108328" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Mount Sinai covenant</span>.</p><p>Many of the laws in that covenant were about how to worship God. They were also about how to treat others. But the people offered <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108256" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">sacrifices</span> they shouldn’t have offered. They didn’t give back to God a <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108382" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">tenth</span> of everything they had. Many men were <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108206" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">married</span> to women who worshipped <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108284" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">false gods</span>. Many men <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108514" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">divorced</span> their wives. The people treated <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108418" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">needy people</span> badly. The <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108333" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">priests</span> didn’t teach the people God’s ways for living.</p><p>Stories recorded in <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108513" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Ezra</span> and <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108515" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Nehemiah</span> showed the people doing these things. These things went against what God wanted his people to do. The people’s questions and replies showed that they didn’t understand who God is or what he desires. God explained that he was their <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108312" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Father</span>, their Master and their Creator. The people belonged to him. They were to be faithful to one another like he was faithful to them.</p><p>God does what is right and fair and brings judgement against those who do evil. God is the <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108226" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Lord</span> who rules over all. He can provide everything that people need. God longed to bless his people with so much that they couldn’t store it all. God would do this if his people lived faithful to the Mount Sinai covenant. This doesn’t mean that God’s people had control over blessings from God. It doesn’t mean that they would be blessed for giving money to God or the temple. That way of thinking is called the <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108579" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">prosperity gospel</span> and it isn’t true.</p><p>What was true was that God’s people needed to be faithful to the Mount Sinai covenant. This would allow the covenant blessings to come to God’s people. But God’s people didn’t believe these things about God. They didn’t trust him to provide the food and drink they needed. They didn’t trust that he punished people who did evil. They asked questions about God being fair. These were like the questions asked in Psalm 73 and like the questions asked by <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108524" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Job</span>. The people didn’t believe that God desired to bless them. They didn’t believe that obeying God faithfully was better than doing what they wanted.</p><p>It seemed to them that obeying God was hard <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108208" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">work</span>. It was hard and didn’t result in anything good for them. For hundreds of years God’s people had refused to <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108255" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">believe in</span> him and trust him. Jews in Malachi’s time had lived through the time of God’s judgement. But most were no more faithful to God than their people of long ago had been. God felt worn out by this.</p></div>

<h2>Malachi 3:16–4:3</h2>

<p>The <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108416" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">prophet</span> Malachi shared God’s message about the <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108571" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">day of the Lord</span>. It was a message of judgement against sinful people. These are people who allow the power of <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108195" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">sin</span> to control them. They choose to do evil things and refuse to stop sinning.</p><p><span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108500" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">God’s anger</span> was compared to a burning furnace. It would burn up these proud and sinful people. That was how God described the action he was going to take. He would take action to completely stop evil and everyone who did evil things.</p><p>This was a message of hope for those who respected God. These people would be full of joy when God brought judgement against evil. This is because it would allow them to be healed by God. They needed to be healed from all the harm that sin and evil cause. Then they could fully enjoy life with God.</p><p>God is the Judge. Only he knows who respects and honours him with all their <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108419" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">heart</span>. Those who respect and honour God were called his special treasure. This showed how much joy God has when people <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108355" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">love him</span>.</p></div>
<div style='direction: ltr;'>
<h2>Malachi 4:4–6</h2>

<p>God longed for his people to believe in him and obey him. He longed for <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108202" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">human beings</span> to live in <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108211" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">peace</span> with him.</p><p>That is why God reminded his people about the teachings of <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108300" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Moses</span>. This was a way to talk about all the stories and laws of God’s people. These stories and laws were part of Scripture. Scripture is <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108200" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">God’s word</span> and is studied by God’s people.</p><p>These stories and laws were recorded in the <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108192" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Old Testament</span>. The Law of Moses showed God’s people how to love, respect and honour God. It showed them how to treat others well. It showed them how to live in peace. This included peace with God, with their families and as a nation.</p><p>God promised to send the prophet <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108486" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Elijah</span> before the day of the Lord came. This was a way of talking about all the messages that God had spoken through prophets. He had spoken the messages to his people over hundreds of years. These messages were also part of the Scripture studied by God’s people. The writings of the prophets taught God’s people the same things that the Law of Moses taught.</p><p>Talking about the prophet Elijah was also a way to talk about a certain messenger. God had talked about this messenger in Malachi 3:1. This messenger would prepare the way for God. The messenger would do this before God came to judge his people.</p><p>Many years later these messages from Malachi helped <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108219" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Jesus</span>’ followers. The messages helped them understand Jesus’ life and work. Jesus explained Malachi’s <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108399" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">prophecy</span> about Elijah. He explained that it was a prophecy about <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108580" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">John the Baptist</span>. This helped Jesus’ followers understand something about Jesus. He is the <span data-bnType="resourceReference" data-resourceId="108329" data-resourceType="BiblicaStudyNotesKeyTerms">Lord</span> that the messenger prepared people for. Jesus is the Lord that they had been longing for.</p></div>
